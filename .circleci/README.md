#README

This is the code that defines our CI/CD flow on CircleCI

#### dev
Deploying to `dev` is automatic for all branches. 
However only the `master` branch is kept running at all times. All other branches are turned off by default (see the `stop-instance` step in config.yml). To allow traffic to pass, one must "start" the instance in the appEngine console.
We have chosen to do this to keep AppEngine costs down.
To override this behaviour include `[deploy]` in your commit message.

Each **branch** that gets deployed and has been started can be reached as
https://<branchname>-dot-open-targets-eu-dev.appspot.com/v<major>/platform

The version that gets deployed in production and staging is instead versioned by github **tag**. 
To deploy staging add a `staging-*whateveryouwant123` tag and to deploy to
production add a `prod-*` tag.

#### staging
Any `stag-*` tag gets deployed to https://staging-api.opentargets.io). 
Each **tag** that gets deployed can be reached as
https://<tagname>-dot-open-targets-staging.appspot.com/v<major>/platform
as well as https://<tagname>.staging-api.opentargets.io/v<major>/platform

Notice that `staging`, differently than `dev`, has a nginx proxy working in front of it. This replicates the production environment and allows load testing with loader.io (there is a token in the nginx.conf that authorizes the domain).

#### production
Any `prod-*` tag gets deployed to https://api.opentargets.io). However:
- Deploying to `production` only happens with manual approval in CircleCI
- Traffic is not migrated automatically and needs to be done manually in each regional project.

Each **tag** that gets deployed can be reached as
https://<tagname>-dot-open-targets-api-prod-<us/jp/eu>.appspot.com/v<major>/platform
as well as through our proxy at https://<tagname>.api.opentargets.io/v<major>/platform
 



### To trigger a staging/production deployment:
**! First ! check** that:
1. you have changed in `config.yml` the value of `ES_URL` for all 3 deploy-jobs
2. you have changed in `config.yml` the value of `DATA_VERSION` for all 3 deploy-jobs
3. Then tag the repo and push:

```sh
TAG=$( echo staging-`date "+%Y%m%d-%H%M"`); git tag $TAG && git push origin $TAG

TAG=$( echo prod-`date "+%Y%m%d-%H%M"`); git tag $TAG && git push origin $TAG
```

### To delete stale "test" tags (except the last two):

```sh
git tag | grep prod-test | head -n -2 | xargs -n 1 -I% gitpush --delete origin %

git tag | grep staging-test | head -n -2 | xargs -n 1 -I% gitpush --delete origin %
```


## What about VERSION?
Deployment does not depend on a change in the VERSION file, but a different version will trigger a new google endpoint deployment and a new `openapi.yaml` specification

Each change in the API should correspond to a version change. 
To change the version, one needs to update the `VERSION` file. This automatically propagates to:
- openapi.yaml template and thus google endpoint definition
- swagger.yaml documentation
