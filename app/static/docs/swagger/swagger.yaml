  title: targetvalidation.org REST API Documentation
  description: |
    You can access all data at the base of targetvalidation.org via a REST API.
    This page explains what each method does and also let's you query the API directly.
    Try building your query using the interactive interface below or
    head to the api tutorials for more complex examples.

    When you use the interactive interface, the API will return a response and you
    will be able to read the equivalent curl command. You can copy and paste it
    directly in the command line to obtain the same results without using your browser.

    All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the https://www.targetvalidation.com/api.
    All data is sent and received as JSON.
    For POST requests, parameters not included in the URL should be encoded as
    JSON by specifying `Content-Type: applicaation/json` in the request header.
    For instance, to query for a specific disease an example call might be

         curl -X POST -d '{"disease":["EFO_0000253"]}' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' https://alpha.targetvalidation.org/public/evidence/filter


    Head to the [API tutorials]() for more examples on how to use the API and code snippets which can be used to construct more complex queries.

      description: |
        We call **evidence** all the data that support a connection between a target and a disease. targetvalidation.org integrates multiple types of evidence including genetic associations, somatic mutations, RNA expression and connections mined from the literature.
        This method allows you to retrieve a single evidence item or a list of evidences by using their targetvalidation.org internal ID.

        Evidence IDs are unique but complicated random strings (eg. `c4c9d3270db7ed179ab488c68a785ecf`).
        Generally, you will have obtained a list of evidence IDs from another API call. Any response from the [/public/evidence/filter](#!/public/get_public_evidence_filter) method for instance, can return a list of evidences and their IDs. See the [API tutorials]() for examples.

        **important note!** A specific evidence ID may change between data releases. We are currently not able to guarantee that a specific evidence ID will forever point to the same piece of evidence connecting target and disease.

        The filter method allows to retrieve the specific data that support a connection between targets and diseases.
        Filters can be used to restrict the results by source and type of data,
        or limit results to targets which are part of a particular pathway in Reactome.
        Minimum and maximum score can be specified as well as the type of evidence linking target and disease.
        Searches can be restricted to pieces of evidence directly linking the two or evidence linking targets with associated diseases.

        After integrating all evidence connecting a target to a specific disease, we
        compute an association score by mean of an harmonic sum. This *association score* provides
        an indication of how strong the evidence behind each connection is and can be
        used to rank genes in order of likelihood as drug targets.
        The association id is constructed by using the ensembl id of the gene and the
        EFO id for the disease (eg. ENSG00000073756-EFO_0003767)
