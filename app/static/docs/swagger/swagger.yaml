  title: The Open Targets Platform REST API
  description: |

    The Open Targets Platform API ('Application Programming Interface')
    allows programmatic retrieval of our data via a set of
    [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
    services.

    You can make calls to the latest version of our API using the base URL
     `https://www.targetvalidation.org/api/latest`. Please make sure you use `https` instead of the unencrypted 
     `http` calls, which we do not accept. Note that we only serve the latest version of the API. If you are interested in querying 
     an old version, please [get in touch](mailto:support@targetvalidation.org) so that we can help.

    We list below the methods available for you to query our data directly from the API. These methods will be 
    automatically generated from our Swagger UI. For every request you create, the interface will display a [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) command 
    that you can copy and paste directly to a shell to obtain the same results without using an internet browser.
    
    Check our [API blog posts](https://blog.opentargets.org/tag/api), for tutorials and additional 
    information on how to access of our data programmatically.

    ### Available Methods

    The available methods can be grouped in four types:

    * __public__ - Methods that serve the core set of our data. These are stable and we fully supported them.
    * __private__ - Methods used by the web app to serve additional data not specific to our platform. These methods
    may change without notice and should be used with caution.
    * __utils__ - Methods to get statistics and technical data about our API.
    * __auth__ - Methods used for authentication. These are only relevant if you have an API key (see the 'Fair Usage 
    and API keys' section below for more details).

    ### Supported formats

    The four methods above are all available via a `GET` request, and will serve outputs as `JSON`.
    Alternative output formats such `xml`, `csv` and `tab` are also available for some of the methods.
    Please note that alternative output formats are not supported in this interactive page. The response here will always be in `json` format.

    If you have complex queries with large number of parameters, you should
    use a `POST` request instead of  `GET`. `POST` methods require a body encoded as `json`.
    When querying for a specific disease using the latest version of the API, your call would look like the example below:

    ```sh
    curl -X POST -d '{"disease":["EFO_0000253"]}' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' https://www.targetvalidation.org/api/latest/public/evidence/filter
    ```
    ### How to interpret a response

    Each HTTP response will serve data in headers and body.
    The headers will give you details about your query, such as how long it took to run, and how much usage you have left (See the 'Fair Usage 
    and API keys' section below for more details).

    In the body of the response, you will find the data you have requested for in a `json` format. The
    [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) program is a useful tool to parse the json response while on the command line.

    ```sh
    curl https://www.targetvalidation.org/api/latest/public/association/filter\?target\=ENSG00000157764 | jq
    ```

    ### Fair Usage and API keys

    We have a usage limit to the calls made to our Open Targets Platform API. The usage is computed based on how much time the
    queries take to get executed in our servers.
    The limit is expressed in milliseconds and is computed over two time windows, namely 10 seconds and 1 hour.
    You can check the usage status in the header response. If the quota is exceeded, a `429` error will get returned.
    The response will also show how much time is needed to wait until a new call can be made. This will be in the `Retry-After` header.
    Please note that if you continue making calls despite the `429` error, your future usage within that time window will be compromised.

    The default usage limit will not impact a typical use of the REST API. But if you plan to do large numbers of requests or are building 
    an application leveraging our API, you need to complete our [Open Targets API key request form](http://goo.gl/forms/heGJvffv7PuUpWzG2).
    The API key will allow you to make more requests than an anonymous user. Using an API key will also help if you are behind a firewall
    (or proxy) in your institution, when many users reach our servers from the same IP address.

    * Request a token with your credentials using the method '/public/auth/request_token'

    ```python
    import requests
    API='https://www.targetvalidation.org/api/latest/'

    jwt = requests.get(API + 'public/auth/request_token',
                     params={'app_name':<appname>,'secret':<secret>})

    print(jwt.json())
    ```
    Once you have the API key, which consists of 'app_name' and 'secret', you need to go through the authorization workflow to use it.

    * Read the token served in the response and pass it into any other following request as an `Auth-Token` header

    ```python
    import requests

    def get_token(app_name,secret):
      jwt = requests.get(API + 'public/auth/request_token',
                     params={'app_name':app_name,'secret':secret})
      return jwt.json()['token']

    token = get_token(<appname>,<secret>)

    response = requests.get(API + 'association/filter',
                        params={'disease':'EFO_0000270'},
                        headers={'Auth-Token': token})

    print(response.json())
    ```

    * By default tokens will expire after 20 minutes. Once your token expires, you will get a `429` error. If it happens you need to request another token.

    Please refrain from requesting a new token for each request you make. This would both impact your usage limit and slow down the calls.

    We do not analyse the nature of any specific API queries except for the purposes of improving the performance of our API.
    Read more in our [privacy section](https://www.targetvalidation.org/terms_of_use#privacy).

    
    How can we make the Open Targets Platform API more useful to you? Would you like additional methods to be implemented?
    Please [get in touch](mailto:support@targetvalidation.org) and send your suggestions.

      description: |
        We call **evidence** a unit of data that support a connection between a target and a disease.
        The Open Targets Platform integrates multiple types of evidence including genetic associations,
        somatic mutations, RNA expression and target-disease associations mined from the literature.
        This method allows you to retrieve a single evidence item or a list of pieces of evidence by using their
        targetvalidation.org ID.

        Evidence IDs are unique within each data release (e.g. `8ed3d7568a8c6cac9c95cfb869bac762` for release 1.2).
        You can obtain a list of evidence and their IDs from other API calls such as [/public/evidence/filter](#!/public/get_public_evidence_filter).

        **Please note** that a specific evidence ID may change between data releases. We can not guarantee that a specific evidence ID will refer to the same piece of evidence connecting a target and its diseases.

        The filter method allows to retrieve the specific data that supports a connection between targets and diseases.
        Filters can be used to restrict the results by source and type of data,
        or limit results to targets which are part of a particular pathway.
        Minimum and maximum scores can be specified as well as the type of evidence linking target and disease.
        **Note** that multiple genes and diseases can be specified in the same request.

       Once we integrate all evidence connecting a target to a specific disease, we
        compute an association score by the means of an harmonic sum. This *association score* provides
        an indication of how strong the evidence behind each connection is and can be
        used to rank genes in order of likelihood as drug targets.
        The association ID is constructed by using the Ensembl ID of the gene and the
        EFO ID for the disease (e.g. ENSG00000073756-EFO_0003767).
        The method returns an association object, which contains the data and summary
        on each evidence type included in the calculation of the score, as well as the score itself.

        - name: id
